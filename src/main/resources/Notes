In JVM there is a place called IoC Container which is created in JVM Heap memory used to initialize, managing and destroying the object creation.
Application Context is the type of IoC Container

Dependency Injection in three different way
1. field injection
@Autowired
Student s;

2. Constructor
3. Setter

web application will have two main parts

client <------------> Server

server contains three main parts
Controller <---> Service layer <----> repo(database)

these three layers are like three class

IoC - Inversion of Control

IoC and Dependency Injection

in Spring object == bean
Application context also called as bean factory

## Setter Injection
1. create a class with private fields
2. create setter methods for private fields
3. Add the property tag in xml file for each field with the name of the setter method without 'set' prefix
4. create application context object in main method and get the bean
5. call the setter methods using bean object

Similarly class object reference can be injected using setter injection
6. create a Pen class with private field of another class type
7. create setter method for that field
8. Add the property tag in xml file for that field with the name of the setter method without 'set' prefix
and give the ref attribute with the bean id of the class type
9. create application context object in main method and get the bean
10. call the setter methods using bean object


## Loose Coupling
-> using interface reference to refer the object of implementation class
-> we can change the implementation class object without changing the code where it is used
-> we can achieve loose coupling using Dependency Injection


## Autowire
-> it is used for automatic dependency injection
-> it can be used with field, constructor and setter method
-> It can be called ByType and ByName
-> ByType: when there is only one bean of that type in the container
-> ByName: when there are multiple beans of that type in the container

this autowire feature can be enabled in xml file using keyword autowire="byName" or "byType" in the bean tag
-> when we use autowire byName, the name of the bean id should be same as the name of the field or setter method
-> when we use autowire byType, there should be only one bean of that type in the container otherwise it will throw exception
   -> If there are multiple beans of that type in the container, we can use Primary param in bean tag to tell spring to use that bean as default
